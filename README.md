This application is for the simulation of signed directed graph which is for fault detection and diagnosis in a process plant
Developmental steps:
 => denoting the sdg  pattern developed  as an arrays [array-a] .
 => collecting values from process variables as an input .
 => converting the input value obtained into signed values using the maximum and minimum value of the process variable.
 => representing the signed value obained in all the variables as an array [array-b].
 => comparing and matching of [array-b] with [array-a] 

 =>displaying the fault pattern matched with the sdg pattern and its fault detection and diagnosis
